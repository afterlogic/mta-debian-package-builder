	   # backend selection, MUST be configured first,
	   # there's no default so you need to set one of
	   # these options:
	   # antispam_backend = crm114
	   # antispam_backend = dspam
	   antispam_backend = mailtrain
	   # antispam_backend = spool2dir

           # whole setup is working)

           # The list of folders for trash, spam and unsure can be given
           # with three options, e.g. "trash" matches the given folders
           # exactly as written, "trash_pattern" accept the * wildcard at
           # the end of the foldername, "trash_pattern_ignorecase"
           # accepts the * wildcard at the end of the foldername _and_
           # matches the name case insensitivly.

           # the *-wildcard with the following meaning:
           #    * at the end: any folder that _start_ with the string
           # e.g.:
           #     antispam_trash_pattern = deleted *;Gel&APY-schte *

           # options antispam_mail_spam and antispam_mail_notspam for
           # the argument that distinguishes between ham and spam.
           # For example:
